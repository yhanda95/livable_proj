#  Global Livability Analysis Dashboard

##  Overview
This project is a **data-driven dashboard** that ranks countries based on **livability metrics**. It combines **public sentiment analysis** with **economic and environmental indicators** to provide policymakers and investors with actionable insights.

üîπ **Sentiment Analysis:** Extracts **public opinions from Reddit** and categorizes sentiment for different aspects (Healthcare, Economy, Environment, etc.).
üîπ **World Bank Data Analysis:** Uses **historical data and Facebook Prophet** to **forecast livability scores** for each country.

Built using **Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and Machine Learning**.
