Algeria,reddit,14rc5gi,Algeria to Replace French Language with English at its Universities,Algeria to Replace French Language with English at its Universities,"No offense to French intended but this is probably the right move. English is spoken by much more of the world. A bit late, but never to late. The whole academic and STEM world has been running on English for a long time now. Anglo Bros we just keep winning. Most people here don't realize the turbulent Algeria has with France. From 1848-1962, besides parts of Algeria being a colony of France, parts of it were actually a part of France itself, not merely a colony.  Over a million Algerians died fighting for their independence against France.

American democracy is more resilient than you might think.

Since his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump has posed a serious threat to American democracy. From the start, he refused to commit to accepting election results. As president, he routinely undermined the rule of law. And he eventually tried to illegally hold on to power after losing the 2020 election, going so far as to incite a deadly i","I do believe American democracy will survive Trump. I am very afraid of the damage he will do to our country, our allies, and of how long it will take to repair our institutions.

Genuine question to all the naysayers, pessimists, and doomers. If you don't think things can be improved, why are you h A lot of this comes down to Americans having a genuine opposition party.

Over the past few weeks, we’ve all seen the same 5-6 Dems who are doing *excellent* work to articulate and activate people (Crockett, AOC, Bernie), but their biggest obstacle is their own party leadership right now.

Just yest Trumpism dies with Trump and Trump is 78 and in declining health. 

Vance tries to be Trump and is very bad at it. Same with Ron DeSantis. 

Trump's kids (whatever happened to them?) are neither interested nor capable of carrying on their father's legacy. I'm not even sure ""withstand"" is the issue. This administration might not even survive the debt call in two weeks. I think the name of the game is protecting as many people who can't protect themselves from becoming collateral damage of the explosion It will withstand if YOU ACTUALLY CALL YOUR REPS AND SENATORS!

Concerns were raised in other subreddits where the survey had asked for gamertags, but this did not apply to the version of the survey posted on our subreddit So they asked permission to perform a study, giving actual university level credentials, then performed their study under false pretenses and then concluded that it was reckless to give them permission to perform the study in the first place?

Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or I think this is partially true for a somewhat limited part of the history and geography of Islam. The countries with the largest numbers of Muslims are Indonesia, Pakistan and India. These are not very Arabized at all.

The next countries are Nigeria, Iran, Egypt and Turkey, which are more Arabized  Islam doesn't arabizes natives, Arab imperialism does.
Muslim countries far from the reach of Arab imperialism don't ""feel"" Arab at all. Places like Malaysia, Indonesia, even Turkey are very culturally different. In the case of Egypt, the dominant culture prior to Islam was Coptic Christianity, and even then it took some hundreds of years before Egypt became a Muslim-majority country.

They shipped you off to a school where you don't even speak the language. Then ignored you until you became something that fit their ideal.
