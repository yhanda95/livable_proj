Democratic Republic of the Congo,rss_www.wired.com,67c5b250cce2fa9ff4ea7116,A Lethal Mystery Illness Spread in Congo. USAID Cuts Have Slowed the Response,"Consequences of the United States rapidly slashing foreign aid are reverberating across the world, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an unidentified illness with Ebola-like symptoms has ravaged several villages. This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC.

Experts say that Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks.

“Medical staff along the Uganda–DRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,” says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on",,environment,,,1741011431.0,https://www.wired.com/story/race-to-identify-drcs-mystery-illness-slowed-by-us-aid-cuts-democratic-republic-congo-usaid/

Ukraine,rss_www.wired.com,67c71c9525f15ababfa9baeb,"If Ukraine Loses Starlink, Here Are the Best Alternatives","For years, Ukrainian officials have hinted that they are working on Starlink alternatives. But the truth is, there aren’t many options on the table.

The one most discussed is OneWeb, a satellite communications network owned by Eutelsat, a satellite operator in France. Like Starlink, this network relies on small, ground-based terminals, and its total constellation includes around 630 low-Earth-orbit satellites, which offer very high-speed connectivity and lower latency than satellites that orbit at higher altitudes.

Joanna Darlington, a spokeswoman for Eutelsat, says that OneWeb offers Europe-wide coverage and that the technology is already deployed in Ukraine to some extent, though she declined to share details. Still, there are more than 40,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine, according to reports, so replacing that network with OneWeb alternatives cannot be done overnight. “It’s possible but it’s not instant coffee,” says Darlington.
