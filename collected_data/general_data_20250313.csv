Canada,rss_www.aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/?t=1741718164,‘Closest target’: Why is Donald Trump so focused on Canada?,"Tariffs and threats to annex Canada fall into Donald Trump’s wider vision for US dominance in the world, experts say.

Montreal, Canada – In his first speech as Canada’s prime minister-designate, Mark Carney delivered what observers have described as a stunning statement.

“I know that these are dark days,” Carney told a room full of supporters on Sunday after he won the race to lead the governing Liberal Party. “Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust.”

The country in question? An ally with which Canada shares the world’s longest undefended land border and, until recently, seemingly unshakeable ties: the United States.

“That is jaw-dropping in the broader context,” Jon Parmenter, a history professor at Cornell University in New York state, said of Carney’s remark.

Experts say the idea that the US can no longer be trusted reflects a sentiment that has been spreading rapidly across Canada in recent months, however.

The Bank of Canada has trimmed its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent and raised concerns about inflationary pressures and weaker growth stemming from trade uncertainty and President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The bank on Wednesday also said it would “proceed carefully with any further changes” to rates given the need to assess both the upward pressures on inflation from higher costs and the downward pressures from weaker demand.

The bank’s stance, which some economists said could be a signal that rates will not fall further, comes after months of inflation sitting at or around its 2 percent target.

Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the United States’ offer to hold talks on its nuclear programme is an attempt to deceive global public opinion, as a letter arrived from US President Donald Trump urging negotiations.

Trump said last week that he had sent a letter to the Iranian leadership seeking negotiations over a new deal with Tehran to restrain its rapidly advancing nuclear programme.

The letter was handed over to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Wednesday by Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates.

While the two officials were meeting, the supreme leader told a group of university students that Trump’s offer “is a deception aimed at shaping global opinion”.

Thousands of people have been gathering in southern Ethiopia for one of the country's biggest cultural events. The week-long Gada ceremony, which ended on Sunday, sees the official transfer of power from one customary ruler to his successor - something that happens every eight years. The tradition of regularly appointing a new Abbaa Gadaa has been practised by the Borana community for centuries - and sees them gather at the rural site of Arda Jila Badhasa, near the Ethiopian town of Arero. It is a time to celebrate their special form of democracy as well as their cultural heritage, with each age-group taking the opportunity to wear their different traditional outfits. These are paraded the day before the official handover during a procession when married women march with wooden batons, called ""siinqee"".

The consequences of the call by the founder of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, for the group to disband are still reverberating – not just in Turkiye but also in the wider region.

Shifting alliances in Syria – exemplified by the recent agreement between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian government – confirm that Ocalan’s message is not isolated or purely domestic but offers a crucial opportunity that could redefine everything from Turkiye’s security policies to the future positioning of Kurdish actors, shaping the next phase of regional power dynamics.

Ocalan, in a statement delivered from a Turkish prison in late February, called on the PKK to “convene your congress and make a decision. All groups must lay down their weapons, and the PKK should dissolve itself.”

It was after 21:00 on Tuesday night in Moscow when the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined the Ukrainian and American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia.

By Wednesday afternoon, the Kremlin appeared to be still weighing its response to the proposals.

Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declined to be drawn into specifics, saying that ""the formation of the position of the Russian Federation [would] take place inside the Russian Federation"".

And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov skirted the issue. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves,"" he said, adding Moscow was ""acquainting itself"" with the joint statement issued in Jeddah.

There are reports that US envoy Steve Witkoff could travel to Moscow on Thursday, and Peskov said the press would be kept informed. Other than this, it was no comment from the Kremlin.

'All of this now hinges on Vladimir Putin's response'

The US is set to introduce a 30-day ceasefire proposal negotiated with Ukraine to Russia in the coming days. Trump administration officials are seeing it as a major breakthrough towards the foreign policy goals of a president who campaigned to end the war. So does it make a ceasefire plausible? And if so, can it end the war after Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago in a just and sustainable way, and on terms that keep the region and the world safe?

Statement: ""Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that R",,general,,,1741769321.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y42125239o

Ukrainian troops appear on the point of losing their hard-won foothold inside Russia’s Kursk region as Moscow claims further advances there and military bloggers on both sides say Kyiv’s forces are withdrawing.

Ukraine sprang one of the biggest shocks of the war on August 6 last year by storming across the border and seizing territory inside Russia, boosting citizens’ morale and gaining a potential bargaining chip.

But after clinging for more than seven months to a gradually shrinking area, Ukraine has seen its position worsen sharply in the past week.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence on Wednesday reported the capture of five more villages, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “the dynamics are good”.
