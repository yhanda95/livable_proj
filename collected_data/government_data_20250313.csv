When people feel completely alienated, they don’t reflect and change—they double down, often to the point of delusion. Instead of creating space for open dialogue, this reaction pushes people into echo chambers where alternative narratives, no matter how extreme, feel safer than engaging with those who reject them outright.

There’s a lot of bad info going out. People posting that whiteboard citing the 2003 SARS outbreak as an example of a disease that was overblown.

It’s important to note that the 2003 SARS strain didn’t lead to being contagious until people displayed symptoms. So you could separate people as soon as  Cleveland Clinic has developed a [COVID-19 test](https://www.cleveland19.com/2020/03/12/cleveland-clinics-new-coronavirus-test-kits-will-deliver-results-within-hours/) that delivers results in hours, as opposed to the CDC’s 2-3 day result waiting period.
