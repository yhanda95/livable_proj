UK and most other places in the British Empire generally used “long-drop” Before this pic was taken he was just plain, old Gary.

Children and innocent people do not deserve to be punished for the acts of Hamas.”

Thank you Senator for saying what should be plainly non controversial I think it's really important for everyone to remember that life in Gaza has been shit for a long time. Even before the siege, the UN estimated that 95% of people in Gaza didn't have access to clean water, unemployment was at 46% and 80% of people living there were relying on aid to survive. That wa Correct. You should be able to condemn a violation of international law without hesitation and it not be controversial. Hamas has committed crimes against humanity but starving people to death through a siege is also a crime against humanity and both are morally abhorrent.

The US decided to turn a blind eye to the coup and to accommodate the military junta and in doing so, « abandoned » France (in the sense not standing with them).

Is obtaining a ""digital residency"" ID from Palau a red flag for my security clearance?

The only reason for obtaining one is to get access to Crypto Exchanges that do not allow US members. Though many do allow the Palau digital residency as  workaround. I am not trying to dodge taxes, but gain access to high leverage crypto exchanges.

This digital residency does not grant citinzship or property, it is a means of work vis","Yes. This is obtaining a foreign benefit, which would be listed. When explaining it and showing you got the id as a loophole to participate in activities which aren’t available to us citizens…it could be a problem. You'll need a real expert to chime in but crypto anything is probably a little sketchy / yellow flag ... getting a pesudo-residency card from a small foreign nation for banking purposes is probably not going to fly well.

Wasn’t that always true? Parliament can set its own laws, and whether those laws are valid only depends on UK law. International courts can only decide whether something is consistent with international agreements, not whether an Act of UK I can’t believe you actually wrote ‘it is now officially written into law that parliament is sovereign’. Can you not see how ridiculous that is? Of course parliament should be sovereign. The only reason the express dis-application of the HRA is necessary is that the HRA (unlike pretty much all other acts of Parliament) isn't subject to the doctrine of implied repeal.

Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that  It's probably just what's in the public consciousness now.
