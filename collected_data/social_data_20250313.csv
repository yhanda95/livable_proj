Nine women journalists in Azerbaijan are marking International Women’s Day behind bars or under house arrest amid the government’s relentless crackdown on critics.

Women journalists and civic activists who speak truth to power face unique risks in Azerbaijan’s patriarchal society.

(Beirut) – Bahraini authorities abuse and threaten children detained in connection with protests and other forms of political expression, Human Rights Watch and Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB) said today. In separate investigations, the rights groups found that although Bahraini authorities released many children from detention in 2024, they have continued to arrest and detain children and violate their rights.

Bahraini authorities should take urgent steps to end the abuse of children in detention, and should only detain children as a last resort in exceptional cases. They should also compensate or provide other appropriate remedies for people who have suffered abuse in detention, including children deprived of their rights during critical childhood years, such as limiting their access to education.

Today, March 10, 2025, Tibetans worldwide commemorate the 1959 uprising in Tibet.

After nearly 70 years of repressive Chinese state rule, government policies that seek to forcibly assimilate non-Han peoples in China under President Xi Jinping represent an alarming turn for the worse for Tibetans.

While the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang received global attention, the slow drip of news about its intensifying repression against Tibetans has garnered less notice due to ever more intrusive and watertight policing, surveillance, and censorship in Tibetan areas.

(Beirut) – After months of legal and political wrangling, an amendment to Iraq’s Personal Status Law that entered into force on February 17, 2025, violates women’s and girls’ rights to equality before the law and puts them at risk of other abuses, Human Rights Watch said today. Persistent pressure and advocacy by women’s rights groups partly reduced the amendment’s harm by retaining provisions for the minimum age of marriage, child custody, and polygamy, but the amended law contains other provisions that threaten women’s and girls’ rights.

Under the new law, couples concluding a marriage contract can choose whether the Personal Status Law of 1959 or a Personal Status Code (mudawana), to be developed by the Shia Ja’afari school of Islamic jurisprudence, would govern their marriage, divorce, childr",,social,,,1741559400.0,https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/03/10/iraq-personal-status-law-amendment-sets-back-womens-rights

While platform companies promote flexibility, the reality for many workers is exclusion from labor and social security rights.

As Deputy UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif noted: “We find ourselves at a moment of considerable change in the world of work. Rapidly evolving technologies are transforming jobs.

On March 7, Pamela Mabini, a community activist and whistleblower was shot and killed outside her home in Kwazakhele, Gqeberha, in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province. Through her nonprofit organization, Maro Foundation, Mabini was known for her activism and charitable work aimed at restoring dignity and reducing crime and violence in her community.

Mabini’s whistleblowing played an instrumental role in the arrest of televangelist Timothy Omotoso and others, who are on trial for rape, racketeering, and human trafficking. Before her murder, she was a regular attendee at the trial, participating in protests and providing support to victims and witnesses.

Mabini’s killing has once again raised concerns about whistleblowers’ safety in South Africa, as many face retaliation, loss of livelihood, and even loss of life.

On Saturday, Myanmar’s junta leader, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, announced during a visit to Belarus that the country would hold national elections by January 2026.

If the proposed timeframe holds, Myanmar’s citizens would head to the polls under a junta that has been committing numerous atrocities since the military took power in a February 2021 coup. Widespread repression, including the arbitrary detention of opposition politicians and the dissolution and criminalization of their political parties, has created a climate of fear that makes free and fair elections impossible. Military abuses are rampant in areas contested by ethnic armed groups and anti-junta forces.

(Bangkok) – Separatist insurgents in Thailand’s deep south carried out a deadly attack on a government office in Su Ngai Kolok district in Narathiwat province, Human Rights Watch said today. The deliberate attack on civilians was an apparent war crime under international humanitarian law.

Credible sources told Human Rights Watch that security camera footage shows that on March 9, 2025, at 7:10 p.m., 10 heavily armed insurgents stormed the compound of Su Ngai Kolok district office while on-duty defense volunteers, who are affiliated with the Interior Ministry, were breaking their Ramadan fast. The insurgents opened fire with assault rifles, threw grenades, and detonated a large car bomb. Two defense volunteers were killed, and eight others were injured. Three passersby were also wounded near the compound.

While platform companies promote flexibility, the reality for many workers is exclusion from labor and social security rights.
